## Terminology

In this section, we want to describe Terminologies  and guide you to create and register your BitShares Account. 

### Wallet

Wallets interacts with the blockchain to process accounts and funds functionalities. Users register to create a single wallet. The single wallet can carry many accounts. Users who have a lifetime membership (LTM) can register multiple accounts in parallel; all of them are stored in a single wallet. Also, users can create multiple wallets to organize their accounts properly.

### Accounts

In BitShares, you can create own **unique account name**, so, you can remember easily. And you will use the account name to communicate (e.g. Send fund) with other BitShares account users (BTS Holders) like an email address. The advantage of using account name is that people can identify you by using a readable and memorable word instead of cryptographic addresses.

Each user has at least one account that can be used to interact with the blockchain. The account can be seen as a single banking account with an individual balance, transaction history, etc. Since these accounts are registered on the blockchain and are open to the public, we recommend to pick a pseudonym to achieve some privacy. 

### Keys

Keys refer to the cryptography used to secure access to your account and funds. It is of importance to prevent others from gaining access to these keys.  

BitShares has *owner, active and memo keys*. And each key has *public key and private key*. It's important to know that Owner permission has administrative powers over the whole account. Active Permission is considered as an “online” permission that allows to access funds and some account settings.

## Advanced: Create an Account


In this section, you will create a **Local Wallet**. 

If you have a Cloud Wallet, you can access your wallet from any browsers. However, the Local Wallet, you can only access your funds from **the same computer and web browser** that you have used to register and create your account.

The Local wallet requires you to create **a backup file** to manage your account and funds. The backup file can be used to move your local wallet to different computers or different browsers if needed. In order to restore your local wallet, you will need the backup file and your password!
